# File-Encrypter

A simplistic GUI wrapper for the file encryption/decryption methods of [Deo's Crypt.ahk lib](https://autohotkey.com/board/topic/67155-ahk-l-crypt-ahk-cryptography-class-encryption-hashing/)

Just pick your preferred encryption & hashing algorithms and enter a password to be used when decrypting. A new folder containing whatever was encrypted will be created in the same directory as the selected files.

I've included a compiled .exe of the script itself but it will not work on 32-bit systems. If you do not want to use the .exe you will need [AutoHotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/) to use the .ahk file. Autohotkey is free and is not a large download. Both the .ahk and the .exe do the same exact thing in terms of functionality, it is merely a matter of convenience as to which one you would like to use.
